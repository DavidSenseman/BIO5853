    "# **Part 3.1: Confidence Intervals**\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Confidence intervals (CIs)_** are a range of values used to estimate the true value of a population parameter based on sample data. They provide a measure of the precision and reliability of the estimate. The most commonly used confidence interval is the 95% CI, which means that if we were to take 100 different samples and compute a CI for each sample, we would expect about 95 of the intervals to contain the true population parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Concepts:**\n",
    "1. **Point Estimate**: The sample statistic (e.g., sample mean) used as the best estimate of the population parameter.\n",
    "2. **Margin of Error**: The range above and below the point estimate that defines the confidence interval.\n",
    "3. **Confidence Level**: The probability that the confidence interval contains the true population parameter (e.g., 95%).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Confidence Intervals are Used in Biostatistics:**\n",
    "1. **Estimating Population Parameters**: CIs are used to estimate population parameters such as means, proportions, and differences between groups. For example, a 95% CI for the mean blood pressure in a population might be 120 to 130 mmHg, suggesting that the true mean is likely within this range¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assessing Precision**: The width of the CI indicates the precision of the estimate. Narrower intervals suggest more precise estimates, while wider intervals indicate less precision².\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hypothesis Testing**: CIs can be used to perform hypothesis tests. If a CI for a difference between two groups does not include zero, it suggests a statistically significant difference³.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Communicating Uncertainty**: CIs provide a way to communicate the uncertainty associated with sample estimates. This is crucial in medical research where decisions are often based on sample data⁴.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example in Biostatistics:\n",
    "Suppose researchers are studying the effect of a new drug on cholesterol levels. They collect data from a sample of patients and calculate the mean reduction in cholesterol. A 95% CI for the mean reduction might be 15 to 25 mg/dL. This interval suggests that the researchers are 95% confident that the true mean reduction in cholesterol for the population lies between 15 and 25 mg/dL."

    "\n",
    "Now that we have investigated the theoretical properties of a distribution of sample means, we are ready to take the next step and apply this knowledge to the process of statistical inference. Recall that our goal is to estimate the population mean associated with a continuous random variable using the information contained in a sample of observations drawn from that population. There are two methods of estimation which are commonly used. The first is called **_point estimation_**; it involves using the sample data to calculate a _single_ number to estimate the parameter of interest. For instance, we might use the sample mean $\\bar{x}$ to estimate the population mean $µ$. The problem is that two different samples are very likely to result in different sample means, and thus there is some degree of uncertainty involved. A point estimate does not provide any information about the inherent variability of the estimator; we do not know how close $\\bar{x}$ is to $µ$ in any given  situation. While $\\bar{x}$ is more likely to be near the true population mean if the sample on which it is  based is large – recall the property of consistency – a point estimate provides no information about the size of this sample.\n",

    "## **Two-Sided Confidence Intervals**\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct a confidence interval for $µ$, we draw on our knowledge of the sampling distribution of the mean from the previous chapter. Given a random variable $X$ that has mean $µ$ and standard deviation $σ$, the central limit theorem states that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Z = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in a step-by-step fashion, the following equation (see page 212) can be derived from the equation above. The general form for a confidence interval for $µ$ can be obtained by introducing some new notation. Let $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ be the (1 − α/2)th percentile of the standard normal distribution. By the  definition of a percentile, the probability that a standard normal random variable $Z$ takes a value less than $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is 1 − α/2, and the probability that it takes a value greater than $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is 1 − (1 − α/2) =  α/2. If α = 0.05, for example, then $z_{1-0.05/2}$ = $z_{0.975}$ = 1.96; if α = 0.01, then $z_{0.995}$ = 2.58. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this notation, the general form for a 100% × (1 − α) confidence interval for $µ$ is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\left( \\bar{X} - z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\bar{X} + z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right). $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "For the 95% confidence interval, the general equation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  \\left( \\bar{X} - 1.96 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\bar{X} + 1.96 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time we compute the mean $\\bar{X}$ of a sample of values (_n_ $\\geq$ 30), we will almost certainly obtain a different value--a different **_point estimate_**. However, due to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), we can be _confident_ that the true population mean $µ$ will not smaller than $\\bar{X} - 1.96 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$, nor is larger than $\\bar{X} + 1.96 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$ in 95 out of 100 experiments (trials).   \n",
    "\n",
    "So instead of simply providing a point estimate of a statistic (e.g. mean), it is also necessary to add a confidence interval to your estimate. A point estimate alone doesn’t convey the uncertainty or variability inherent in your point estimate. A confidence interval provides a range within which the true parameter value is likely to fall, giving a sense of the estimate’s precision. Confidence intervals can also be used to assess statistical significance. If a confidence interval for a difference between groups does not include zero, it suggests that there is a statistically significant difference.\n"

    "\n",
    "The **_Student’s t-distribution_** is a probability distribution used in statistics when the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown. It was introduced by William Sealy Gosset under the pseudonym “Student.”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Symmetrical and Bell-Shaped:** Similar to the normal distribution but with heavier tails, meaning it has a higher probability for extreme values.\n",
    "* **Degrees of Freedom (df):** The shape of the _t_-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom, which is related to the sample size. As the degrees of freedom increase, the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### **Importance in Biostatistics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Small Sample Sizes:** In biostatistics, researchers often work with small sample sizes. The _t_-distribution is crucial for making inferences about the population mean when the sample size is less than 30.\n",
    "2. **Unknown Population Standard Deviation:** When the population standard deviation is unknown, the _t_-distribution provides a more accurate estimate than the normal distribution.\n",
    "3. **Hypothesis Testing:** The _t_-distribution is used in t-tests to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. This is particularly important in clinical trials and medical research to compare treatment effects.\n",
    "4. **Confidence Intervals:** It helps in constructing confidence intervals for the mean, which is essential for estimating the range within which the true population parameter lies with a certain level of confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example in Biostatistics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a clinical trial testing a new drug. Researchers want to compare the mean blood pressure reduction between the treatment group and the control group. With a small sample size and unknown population standard deviation, they would use the _t_-distribution to perform a _t_-test and determine if the observed difference is statistically significant."
