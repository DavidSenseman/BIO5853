        "\n",
        "For all the statistical tests we have studied up to this point, the populations from which the data were sampled were assumed to be at least approximately normally distributed, or the sample sizes were large enough that the central limit theorem could be applied. Normality of the populations is necessary for the tests to be valid. Since the forms of the underlying distributions are assumed to be known and only the values of certain parameters – the means and standard deviations of the normal distributions – are not, these procedures are called parametric tests. If the data do not conform to the assumptions made by such traditional techniques, nonparametric methods of statistical inference can be used instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nonparametric techniques make fewer assumptions about the nature of the underlying probability distributions. As a result, they are sometimes called distribution-free  methods. Nonparametric tests of hypothesis follow the same general procedure as the parametric tests we have already studied. We begin by making some claim about the underlying populations in the form of a null hypothesis. We calculate a test statistic based on random samples of observations drawn from the underlying populations. We then use the value of the test statistic to determine a _p_ -value, compare the _p_ -value to the significance level of the test $\\alpha$, and either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis ($H_0$).\n",

If the difference is less than 0, the pair receives a minus sign. Here, the healthy subject has the higher ree.

Equivalently, the probability that a particular difference is positive is 0.5, and the probability that the difference is negative is also 0.5. If a plus sign is considered to be a “success,” the _n_ plus and minus signs can be thought of as the outcomes of a Bernoulli random variable with probability of success p = 0.5.

        "Although the sign test frees us from having to make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of differences, it also ignores some potentially useful information: the magnitude of these differences. For patients with cystic fibrosis and healthy individuals matched on age, sex, height, and weight, a difference in `ree` of 8 kcal/day is counted the same as a different of 472 kcal/day. As a result, the sign test is not often used in practice. Instead, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test can be used to compare two populations that are not independent. Like the sign test – and the paired _t_ -test – the signed-rank test does not consider the measurements sampled from the two populations separately. Instead, it focuses  on the difference in values for each pair of observations. It does not require that the population of these differences be normally distributed. However, it does take into account the magnitudes of the differences as well as their signs. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is used to evaluate the null hypothesis that in the underlying population of differences among pairs, the median difference is equal to 0. The alternative hypothesis is that the population median difference is not equal to 0.\n",

The members of the first population have average daily serum phenylalanine levels below 10.0 mg/dl and are considered to have low exposure; those in the second  population have average levels above 10.0 mg/dl and are labeled as high exposure. We would like to  compare mental age scores normalized to 48 months for these two groups of children using a test  conducted at the 0.05 level of significance.

Table 13.3 displays samples taken from the two populations of children with  pku; there are 21 children with low exposure and 18 children with high exposure. We combine the two samples into one large group, order the observations from smallest to largest, and assign a rank to each one. If there are tied observations, we assign an average rank to all measurements  with the same value. Note, for instance, that two of the children in the sample have a normalized mental age score of 37.0 months. Since these observations are fourth and fifth in the ordered list of 39 measurements, we assign an average rank of (4 + 5)/2 = 4.5 to each one. Similarly, three  subjects have a normalized mental age score of 51.0 months; these observations each receive a rank  of (22 + 23 + 24)/3 = 23.  \n",

        "The **_Kruskal-Wallis_** test is an extension of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test which can be used to compare three or more independent populations. It is the nonparametric counterpart to the one-way analysis of variance, but does not require that the underlying populations be normally distributed or that their variances be equal. Like the Wilcoxon rank sum test, it does assume that the _k_ populations being compared all have the same basic shape. The Kruskal-Wallis test evaluates the null hypothesis that the medians of the _k_ populations are identical. The alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the population medians differs from one of the others.  \n",

We wanted to determine whether patients from these institutions were in fact comparable before combining them for analysis. We assumed that forced expiratory volume in 1 second (`fev1`) was approximately normally distributed, and tested the null hypothesis that mean fev1 was identical  for males with coronary artery disease at each of the k = 3 centers. With a _p_ -value between 0.05 and 0.10 (p = 0.052, using Stata), we were strictly unable to reject the null hypothesis that mean  pulmonary function is identical at the three centers at the 0.05 level of significance.  \n",

We then find the sum of the ranks corresponding  to each of the original samples, and label these R1 for the first sample, R2 for the second sample,  and R3 for the third sample. Under the null hypothesis that the underlying populations have identical  medians, we expect the ranks to be distributed randomly among the three groups, and the average  ranks to be approximately equal.

        "## **Advantages and Disadvantages of Nonparametric Methods**  \n",
        "\n",
        "Nonparametric techniques have several **_advantages_** over traditional methods of statistical inference. One advantage is that they do not require all the restrictive assumptions characteristic of parametric tests. It is not necessary that the underlying populations be normally distributed, for instance. At most, when two or more independent populations are being compared they should have the same basic shape. Their use of ranks makes nonparametric techniques less sensitive to measurement error than traditional tests. They can also be applied to ordinal or discrete data, in addition to continuous measurements. Since it does not make sense to calculate either a mean or a standard deviation for  ordinal values, parametric tests are usually not appropriate.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Nonparametric methods also have **_disadvantages_**. If the assumptions underlying a parametric test are satisfied, the nonparametric test is less powerful than the comparable parametric technique. This means that if the null hypothesis is false, the nonparametric test would require a larger sample to provide sufficient evidence to reject it. This loss of power is not substantial, however. If the  sample data do come from an underlying normal population, the power of the Wilcoxon tests is approximately 95% of that for the _t_ tests. In other words, if the _t_ test requires 19 observations to achieve a particular level of power, the Wilcoxon test would need 20 observations to have the same power. Another disadvantage is that the hypotheses tested by nonparametric techniques tend to be less specific than those tested by traditional methods, focusing on medians rather than means. Because they rely on ranks rather than on the actual values of the observations, nonparametric tests do not use all the information known about a distribution.\n",
