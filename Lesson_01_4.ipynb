    "* **Range and Variability:** By examining a histogram, you can see the data range and get a qualitative sense of variability and central tendency.\n",

    "* **Identifying Patterns:** They help in identifying patterns, trends, and clusters within the data. For example, a linear pattern might suggest a linear relationship, while a curved pattern might indicate a non-linear relationship.\n",
    "* **Detecting Outliers:** Scatterplots make it easy to spot outliers, which are data points that deviate significantly from the overall pattern.\n",
    "* **Assessing Strength and Direction:** The scatterplot can indicate the strength (how closely the points cluster around a line) and direction (positive or negative) of the relationship between the variables.\n",
