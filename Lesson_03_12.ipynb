        "**Survival analysis** is a branch of statistics that deals with the analysis of time-to-event data. The \"event\" can be any significant occurrence or endpoint of interest, such as death, disease recurrence, equipment failure, etc. The key focus is on estimating the time until the event occurs and understanding the factors that influence this timing.\n",

        "#### Key Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Survival Function**:\n",
        "    - Represents the probability that an individual survives beyond a certain time.\n",
        "    - Typically denoted as \\( S(t) \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Hazard Function**:\n",
        "    - Describes the instantaneous rate of the event occurring at a particular time, given that the individual has survived up to that time.\n",
        "    - Denoted as \\( \\lambda(t) \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Censoring**:\n",
        "    - Occurs when the exact time of the event is unknown for some individuals. This can happen due to individuals leaving the study early, the study ending before the event occurs, etc.\n",
        "    - Censoring is a crucial aspect of survival analysis as it allows for the inclusion of incomplete data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Importance in Biostatistics\n",
        "\n",
        "Survival analysis is particularly important in biostatistics for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Medical Research**:\n",
        "    - Helps in understanding the effectiveness of treatments and interventions.\n",
        "    - Used to estimate survival rates for different conditions and to identify risk factors associated with poor outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Clinical Trials**:\n",
        "    - Essential for analyzing time-to-event data, such as the time until disease recurrence or progression-free survival.\n",
        "    - Provides insights into the long-term benefits and risks of treatments.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Public Health**:\n",
        "    - Supports the development of preventive measures by identifying factors that influence the timing of health-related events.\n",
        "    - Assists in planning and resource allocation by predicting future trends in disease occurrence and survival rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Epidemiology**:\n",
        "    - Vital for studying the natural history of diseases and the impact of exposures on the timing of health outcomes.\n",
        "    - Facilitates the comparison of survival experiences between different groups (e.g., exposed vs. unexposed, treated vs. untreated).\n",

        "\n",
        "In Chapter 4 we use the life table to consider the problem of quantifying how long individuals in a population survive as that population ages. More generally, the variable we are interested in may be the length of time from an initial start point until the occurrence of some specified event. This is\n",
        "often the time from birth until death, but might also be the time from transplant surgery until the new organ fails, or the time from start of maintenance therapy for a patient whose cancer has gone into remission until the relapse of disease. The time interval between the start point and the subsequent event — often called a failure event — is known as the _survival time_. The analysis of time to event data generally focuses on estimating the probability that an individual will survive beyond a given length of time.\n",
        "\n",
        "One common occurrence when working with survival data is that not all individuals are observed until their respective times of failure. If the time interval between the start point and the subsequent failure event can be quite long, the data may be analyzed before the failure event has occurred in\n",
        "all study subjects. Not everyone has died, or has experienced organ failure, or has had their cancer return. Others who either move away before the study is complete or who refuse to participate any longer are said to be _lost to follow-up_. The incomplete observation of time to failure is known as _censoring_. The presence of censored observations distinguishes the analysis of survival data from other analyses of continuous measurements.\n",
        "\n",
        "A distribution of survival times can be characterized by a _survival function_, represented by $S(t)$. $S(t)$ is defined as the probability that an individual survives beyond time $t$. Equivalently, for a given $t$, $S(t)$ specifies the proportion of individuals who have not yet failed at that time. If $T$ is a random variable representing survival time, then\n",

        "$$ S(t) = P(T>t). $$\n",
