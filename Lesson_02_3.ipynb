    "In the previous chapter we examine theoretical probability distributions,such as the binomial distribution and the normal distribution. In all cases the relevant population parameters are assumed to be known; this allows us to describe the distributions completely and calculate the probabilities associated with various outcomes. In most practical applications, however, we are not given the values of these parameters. Instead, we must attempt to describe or estimate a population parameter – such as the mean of a normally distributed random variable – using the information contained in a sample of observations selected from the population. The process of drawing conclusions about an entire population based on the information contained in a sample is known as **_statistical inference_**. \n",

    "\n",
    "An **_Experimental Distribution_** refers to the distribution of data points collected from an experiment. It represents the frequencies or probabilities of different outcomes observed during the experiment. This type of distribution is crucial for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Definition**\n",
    "An experimental distribution is essentially a _histogram_ or probability distribution derived from experimental data. It shows how often each outcome occurs, providing a visual and statistical representation of the data collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Importance**\n",
    "1. **Understanding Data Patterns:** It helps in identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies in the experimental data. This can be crucial for making informed decisions based on the observed outcomes.\n",
    "2. **Hypothesis Testing:** Experimental distributions are used to test hypotheses. By comparing the experimental distribution to a theoretical distribution, researchers can determine if their hypotheses hold true.\n",
    "3. **Estimating Parameters:** It allows for the estimation of parameters such as mean, variance, and standard deviation, which are essential for summarizing and understanding the data.\n",
    "4. **Model Validation:** Experimental distributions are used to validate statistical models. By comparing the model’s predictions to the experimental distribution, researchers can assess the model’s accuracy and reliability.\n",
    "5. **Decision Making:** In fields like engineering, medicine, and social sciences, experimental distributions provide the empirical evidence needed to make critical decisions.\n",
    "6. **Identifying Relationships:** They help in identifying relationships between variables, which can be crucial for understanding cause-and-effect dynamics in experimental research12."

    "Ideally, if we wanted to know the mean serum cholesterol levels for males in the US, we would measure the **_entire male population_**. That would be impractical. As of July 1, 2022, there were approximately 165.28 million males living in the United States. But what we can do, is measure serum cholesterol in a **_sample_** of US males. The obvious approach would be to use the mean of the sample as an estimate of the unknown population mean $µ$. The sample mean $\\bar{X}$ is called an **_estimator_** of the parameter $µ$. There are many different approaches to the process of estimation. If we assumed the population to be normally distributed, the sample mean $\\bar{X}$ is something called a **_maximum likelihood estimator_**. The method of maximum likelihood finds the value of the parameter that is most likely to have produced the observed sample  data. This method can usually be relied on to yield reasonable estimators. Note, however, that two different samples are likely to result in **_different sample means_**; consequently, there is some degree  of uncertainty involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in the cell belows creates an **_Experimental Distribution_** fron the data stored in `scDF`. This experimental distribution is called `chol_expDist_ar` and it is a Numpy array, not a Pandas DataFrame. You can think of this numpy array as containing the serum cholesterol measurement for each male in the sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the lowest serum cholesterol level measured (80-119, midpoint=99.5) there were 13 'young' men and 5 'old' men for a total of 13 'males'. Using a simple `for loop`, the code adds 13 values of 99.5 to `chol_expDist_ar`. During the next turn of the loop, the next lowest values of serum cholesterol (120-159, midpoint=139.5) are added. Since 150 'young' men and 48 'old' had a serum cholesterol value between 120-159--for a total of 198 males--$198$ copies of the midpoint number $139.5$ are againh added to the experimental distribution. By the end the for loop, `chol_expDist_ar` contains 2295 serum cholesterol (midpoint) values--one for each male in the sample.  \n",

    "The first array, `total_ar`, contains the total number of subjects that had a specific cholesterol value, while the second array, `chol_ar`, contains the corresponding serum cholesterol (\"midpoint\") values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last two arrays, `dummy_array` and `chol_expDist_ar` are initialized, but contain no data -- they will be filled with data later. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main component of the code is the `for loop`. The `for loop` makes 9 iterations (i.e. 'loops')--one loop for each of the 9 serum cholesterol levels. During each pass through the loop, our special function `add_repeated_number()` is called. As an argument, the function is given a specific midpoint cholesterol value and the number of males that had that value. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, during the first loop pass, the counter variable `i` is equal to 0. The special function is passed the value in  of `males_ar[0]` which is $13$, and the corresponding cholesterol value in `chol_ar[0]` which is $99.5$. These two values are passed the special function. `add_repeated_number()`. The special function generates 13 copies of $99.5$ and \"returns\" these 13 copies in the variable `result`. The last line of the `for loop` uses the `np.concatenate()` function to add these 13 copies of $99.5$ to the numpy array `scDF_expDist_ar`. \n",

    "for i in range(len(chol_ar)):\n",

    "    chol_expDist_ar  = np.concatenate((chol_expDist_ar, result), axis=None)\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "After the `for loop` has completed 9 turns--one turn for example cholesterol (midpoint) level--it will have added 2295 cholesterol values to the `scDF_expDist_ar`--one serum cholesterol value for each male subject. In other words, the code is essentially recreating the \"raw data\" obtained in the study and storing these data points in the numpy array, `scDF_expDist_ar`.  \n",

    "1. **Visualization of Data:** It provides a clear visual representation of the data, making it easier to understand the underlying patterns, trends, and anomalies. This can be particularly helpful in identifying outliers or unusual observations.\n",

    "## **Sampling Distributions of the Mean**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **_Sampling Distribution of the Mean_** is the probability distribution of all possible sample means of a given size from a population. It is a fundamental concept in inferential statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Characteristics**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Central Limit Theorem (CLT):** Regardless of the population’s distribution, the sampling distribution of the mean will tend to be normally distributed if the sample size is sufficiently large (usually ( $n \\geq 30$).\n",
    "2. **Mean of the Sampling Distribution:** The mean of the sampling distribution ($\\mu_{\\bar{x}}$) is equal to the mean of the population ($\\mu$).\n",
    "3. **Standard Error:** The standard deviation of the sampling distribution ($\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}$), known as the standard error, is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma_{\\bar{x}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$$​\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation and $n$ is the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Importance**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Estimation:** Sampling distributions allow us to estimate population parameters (like the mean) from sample statistics.\n",
    "2. **Hypothesis Testing:** They provide the basis for conducting hypothesis tests. By comparing the sample mean to the sampling distribution, we can determine the likelihood of observing such a sample mean if the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "3. **Confidence Intervals:** They are used to construct confidence intervals for population parameters, giving us a range of plausible values for the parameter."

    "For the purposes of illustration, suppose we could measure the serum cholesterol value for **_all_** the males in a population? In that case, we can easily find the **_true population mean_**, $µ$, by adding up all the serum cholesterol values and dividing by the population size, $N$. In this instance, there is only a single value for the mean, $µ$.\n",

Alpine has a population of only ~2300 males, so it is conceivable that we could obtain a cholesterol measurement for every male resident of Alpine. So, let's imagine that we did this and our measurements--all 2295 serum cholesterol values--are in stored in the Numpy array `scDF_expDist_ar`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This Numpy array is no longer an Experimental Distribution, but instead, it is now a **Population Distribution** since it contains the cholesterol value for _every_ member in the entire population being investigated! In Example 3 we measured the mean of this experimental distribution to be `215.11 mg/dl`. If `scDF_expDist_ar` is now a population distribution, the value `215.11 mg/dl` would be the population mean, $µ$. There is no uncertainity associated with this value. There is no standard deviation or variance. The value `215.11 mg/dl` is not an estimate, but the **_true_** mean for our population of male residents of Alpine, Texas. \n",

    "Mathematically, if $X_1$, $X_2$, $\\ldots$, $X_n$) are independent and identically distributed random variables with mean ($\\mu$) and variance ($\\sigma^2$), then the sample mean ($\\bar{X}$) is approximately normally distributed:\n",

Theoretically, we must enumerate all possible random samples; for now, however, we select 100 samples of size 25. A histogram of the 100 sample means is displayed in **Figure 8.6**. According to the central limit theorem, the distribution of the sample means possesses three  properties. First, its mean should be equal to the population mean µ = 79.2 years. In fact, the mean of the 100 sample means is 79.8 years. Second, we expect the standard error of the sample means to  be σ/√ n = 16.4/ √ 25 = 3.3 years. The calculated standard error is 2.9 years. Finally, the distribution  of sample means should be approximately normal. The shape of Figure 8.6 – and the theoretical  normal distribution superimposed over the histogram – suggest that this third property holds true.  Note that this is a large departure from the population distribution illustrated in Figure 8.2, or from  any of the individual samples shown in Figures 8.3 through 8.5. If n were larger, we would expect  the distribution to look even more normal.  Based on the sampling distribution,\n",

While there is a small, but obvious increase in the probability of dying at the time of birth (0 years), the probability of dying remains low through your teens, twenties and thirties, and then starts to increase more rapidly in your fifties and sixties, reaching a peak around 80-85 years. After this peak, the probability of dying decreases simply because there are less and less people who are still alive. The important point is that the population is clearly **_not_** a \"bell-shaped\" curve.\n",

    "Now look at the _right histogram_ showing the distribution of **sample means** that were obtained from the population shown in the left histogram. It follows very closely the dark red line which is a plot of a normal distribution. In other words, while a population made not have a normal distribution, if you take many random samples from this population, a make a histogram of the average (mean) value of each random sample, you are **_guaranteed_** that this sample means with be normally distributed. \n",
