In particular, it allows us to predict the value of a response or outcome that corresponds to a given value of an explanatory variable. If knowing the value of a single explanatory variable improves our ability to predict the response, however, we might suspect that additional explanatory variables could be used to our advantage. To investigate the more complicated relationship among a number of different variables, we use a natural extension of simple linear regression known as **_multiple linear regression_**, or **_multivariable linear regression_**.\n",

        "As a general rule, we prefer to include in a multivariable regression model only those explanatory variables that help us to predict or to explain the observed variability in the response $( y $), the coefficients of which can be accurately estimated â€“ what we call a parsimonious model. Consequently, if we are presented with a number of potential explanatory variables, how do we decide which ones to retain in the model and which to leave out? This decision is usually made based on a combination of statistical and nonstatistical considerations. Initially, we should have some prior knowledge as to which variables might be important. To study the full effect of each of these explanatory variables, however, it would be necessary to perform a separate regression analysis for each possible combination of the variables. The resulting models would then be evaluated according to some statistical criteria. This strategy for finding the \"best\" regression equation is known as the all possible models approach. While it is the most thorough method, it is also extremely time consuming. If we have a large number of potential explanatory variables, the procedure may not be feasible. As a result, we frequently resort to one of several alternative approaches for choosing a regression model. The two most commonly used procedures are known as _forward selection_ and _backward elimination_.\n",

The coefficient of determination is represented by $R^2$, and is the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient $r$ between $Y$ and $X$; consequently,  $r^2 = R^2$.  Since _r_ can assume any value in the range âˆ’1 to 1, $R^2$ must lie between 0 and 1. If $R^2$ = 1, all  of the data points in the sample fall directly on the least squares line. If $R^2$ = 0, there is no linear  relationship between x and y. The coefficient of determination can be interpreted as the proportion of the variability among the observed values of $y$ that is explained by the linear regression of $y$ on $x$.
