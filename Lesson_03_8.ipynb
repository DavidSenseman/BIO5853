        ">Suppose that we are interested in a pair of continuous random variables, each of which is measured on the same set of persons, hospitals, countries, or other units of study. For example, we might wish to investigate the relationship between the percentage of children who have been immunized against the infectious diseases diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (dpt) in a given country, and the corresponding mortality rate for children under 5 years of age. The United Nations Children’s Fund considers the under-5 mortality rate to be one of the most important indicators of the level of well-being for a  population of children. The data for a sample of 20 countries from around the world are shown in Table 16.1. If X represents the percentage of children receiving all three of the required doses of the dpt vaccine, and Y represents the under-5 mortality rate, we have a pair of outcomes (xi, yi) for each nation in the sample. The first country on the list, Bolivia, has a dpt immunization percentage of 83% and an under-5 mortality rate of 27 per 1000 live births; therefore, this country is represented by the data  point (83, 27).\n",
        ">\n",
        ">Before we conduct any type of analysis of these data, we should always create a **_two-way scatter plot_**. If we place the outcomes of the X variable along the horizontal axis and the outcomes of the Y variable along the vertical axis, each point on the graph represents a combination of values (xi, yi). We can often determine whether a relationship exists between x and y – the outcomes of the random variables X and Y – simply by examining the graph. As an example, the data from Table 16.1 are plotted in Figure 16.1. The percentage of children immunized against dpt is shown on the horizontal  axis and the under-5 mortality rate on the vertical axis. Not surprisingly, the mortality rate tends to decrease as the percentage of children immunized increases.\n",
