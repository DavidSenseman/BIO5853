    "# **Part 3.2: Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Hypothesis Testing_** is a statistical method used to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. It involves formulating a hypothesis, collecting data, and then determining whether the data supports or refutes the hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** A statement that there is no effect or no difference. It serves as the default or starting assumption.\n",
    "2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha):** A statement that there is an effect or a difference. It is what you aim to support.\n",
    "3. **Test Statistic:** A standardized value calculated from sample data, used to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "4. **P-Value:** The probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A low p-value (typically < 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "5. **Significance Level (α):** The threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis, commonly set at 0.05.\n",
    "6. **Type I Error:** Incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (false positive).\n",
    "7. **Type II Error:** Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false (false negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Steps in Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Formulate Hypotheses:** Define the null and alternative hypotheses.\n",
    "2. **Choose a Significance Level:** Decide on the α level (e.g., 0.05).\n",
    "3. **Collect Data:** Gather sample data relevant to the hypothesis.\n",
    "4. **Calculate Test Statistic:** Compute the test statistic based on the sample data.\n",
    "5. **Determine P-Value:** Find the p-value corresponding to the test statistic.\n",
    "6. **Make a Decision:** Compare the p-value to the significance level and decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Importance in Biostatistics:**\n",
    "* **Medical Research:** Hypothesis testing is crucial in clinical trials to determine the efficacy of new treatments or drugs. For example, it helps in comparing the effectiveness of a new drug against a placebo.\n",
    "* **Public Health:** It aids in identifying risk factors for diseases and evaluating the impact of public health interventions.\n",
    "* **Epidemiology:** Used to test associations between exposures and health outcomes, such as the link between smoking and lung cancer.\n",
    "* **Quality Control:** Ensures that medical devices and procedures meet safety and efficacy standards.\n",
    "* **Decision Making:** Provides a systematic approach to making data-driven decisions in healthcare and policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Imagine a study testing whether a new drug lowers blood pressure more effectively than an existing drug. The null hypothesis (H₀) might state that there is no difference in blood pressure reduction between the two drugs. The alternative hypothesis (H₁) would state that the new drug is more effective. By collecting and analyzing sample data, researchers can use hypothesis testing to determine if there is enough evidence to support the new drug’s efficacy."

    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In our study of confidence intervals, we encountered the distribution of serum cholesterol levels for the population of males in the United States who are hypertensive and who smoke. This distribution is  approximately normal with unknown mean µ. However, we do know that the mean serum cholesterol level for the general population of all 20- to 74-year-old males in the United States is 211 mg/100 ml. Therefore, we might wonder whether the mean cholesterol level of the subpopulation of males who are hypertensive smokers is 211 mg/100 ml as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we select a random sample of size 25 from this subpopulation and the mean serum cholesterol level for the sample is $\\bar{x}$ = 220 mg/100 ml, is this sample mean compatible with a hypothesized mean of 211 mg/100 ml? \n",
    "\n",
    "We know that some amount of sampling variability is to be expected. What if the sample mean is 230 mg/100 ml, or 250 mg/100 ml? How far from 211 must $\\bar{x}$ be before we can conclude that µ is really equal to  some other value?\n",

    "$$ H_0: µ = µ_0 = 211 mg/100 ml. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The symbol $H_0$ is called the **_null hypothesis_**. In this particular equation, the null hypothesis is claiming that the mean of the population $µ$ is equal to some postulated value $µ_0$ which is equal to 211 mg/100ml.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example used in your textbook asks the question whether males who smoke and have hypertension, have the same serum cholesterol values as the general male population? \n",
    "\n",
    "We know that in the general US male population serum cholesterol has a mean value $µ$ = 211 mg/100ml with a standard deviation of 46 mg/100ml. The null hypothes $H_0:$ assumes that smoking and hypertension has **_no effect_** on serum cholesterol levels, so that blood samples from smoking males with hypertension will have the same mean value of 211 mg/100ml as the general male population.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem arises when we try to test our hypothesis. If we measure the serum cholesterol level in a sample of blood from 25 males who smoke and have hypertension, we already know that it is highly unlikely that our sample mean $\\bar{x}$ will be exactly 211 mg/100ml. Why?  Because of 'sampling error', or more colloquially, 'the luck of the draw'. As we saw in earlier lessons, every time we compute the mean of samples taken from a population, we get different values. That is \"sampling error\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of **_Hypothesis Testing_** can be used to answer the following question: \n",
    "\n",
    ">_How much can sampling error make the sample mean ($\\bar{x}$) different from the population mean (µ) even if they are from the same population and therefore should have the same value?_\n",
    "\n",

By “more extreme,” we mean farther away from $µ_0$ in the direction of the alternative hypothesis. Because it relies on the standard normal distribution, a test of this kind is called a **_one-sample z-test_**.  \n",

A _p_-value is a measure of the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis, with smaller _p_-values indicating stronger evidence against $H_0$. Because it is a probability, a _p_-value is continuous. Even though it is customary to report whether results are statistically significant or not, we must take care not to rely exclusively on a rigid division of study conclusions into two distinct boxes. In response to what many consider to be an over-simplification when reporting results, the American Statistical Association released a statement on statistical significance and _p_-values which clarifies several important points about what _p_-values can and cannot do in practice.  \n",
    "1. _P_-values can indicate how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model.\n",
    "2. _P_-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone.\n",
    "3. Scientific conclusions and business or policy decisions should not be based only on whether a _p_-value passes a specific threshold.\n",
    "4. Proper inference requires full reporting and transparency.\n",
    "5. A _p_-value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result.\n",
    "6. By itself, a _p_-value does not provide a good measure of evidence regarding a model or hypothesis. \n",

Suppose that we do not know the true mean of this population; however, we do know that the mean serum cholesterol level for the subpopulation of 20- to 24-year-old males is 180 mg/100 ml. Since older men tend to have higher cholesterol levels than do younger men on average, we would expect the mean cholesterol level of the population of 20- to 74-year-olds to be higher than 180 mg/100 ml.

    "#### **Dual Plots Distribution of Means of Samples**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the probability of making a type II error, $\\beta$, is the probability of not rejecting the null  hypothesis given that $H_0$ is false. Therefore, it is the chance of obtaining a sample mean which is less  than 195.1 mg/100 ml given that the true population mean is not 180 but is instead $\\mu_1$ = 211 mg/100 ml. To find the value of $\\beta$, we again consider the sampling distribution of means of samples of size 25; this time, however, we let $\\mu$ = 211. This distribution is pictured on the right side of **Figure 10.2**. Since a sample mean less than $\\bar{x}$ = 195.1 mg/100 ml implies that we do not reject $H_0$, we would  like to know what proportion of this new distribution centered at 211 mg/100 ml lies below 195.1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z = \\frac{195.1 - 211.0}{46/\\sqrt{25}} = -1.73 $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The area under the standard normal curve that lies to the left of $z = −1.73$ is `0.042`. Therefore, $\\beta$ – the probability of failing to reject  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H_0: \\mu \\leq 180 \\text{ mg}/100 \\text{ ml} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "when the true population mean is $µ_1$ = 211 mg/100 ml – is equal to `0.042`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas $\\alpha$, the probability of committing a type I error, is determined by looking at the situation in which $H_0$ is true and µ is equal to $µ_0$, $\\beta$ is found when $H_0$ is false and $\\mu$ does not equal $\\mu_0$. If $\\mu$ is not equal to $µ_0$, however, there are an infinite number of possible values that $\\mu$ could assume. The type II error is calculated for a single such value, $\\mu_1$; in the previous example, $\\mu_1$ was chosen to be 211 mg/100 ml. (We selected 211 because in this unusual example, we knew it to be the true population mean.) If we had chosen a different alternative population mean, then we would have computed a different value for $\\beta$. The closer $\\mu_1$ is to $\\mu_0$, the more difficult it is to reject the null hypothesis and the higher $\\beta$ will be. \n",
