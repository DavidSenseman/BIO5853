        "Like correlation analysis, **_simple linear regression_** is a technique that is used to explore the nature of the relationship between two continuous random variables. The primary difference between these two analytical methods is that regression enables us to investigate the change in one variable, called the **_response_** or **_outcome_**, which corresponds to a given change in the other, the **_explanatory variable_**. Correlation analysis makes no such distinction; the two variables involved are treated symmetrically. The ultimate objective of regression analysis is to predict or estimate the value of the response that is associated with a fixed value of the explanatory variable.  \n",

Is it a good model? There are  several methods available to help evaluate the fit of a linear regression model.\n",

The coefficient of determination is represented by $R^2$, and is the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient $r$ between $Y$ and $X$; consequently,  $r^2 = R^2$.  Since _r_ can assume any value in the range âˆ’1 to 1, $R^2$ must lie between 0 and 1. If $R^2$ = 1, all  of the data points in the sample fall directly on the least squares line. If $R^2$ = 0, there is no linear  relationship between x and y. The coefficient of determination can be interpreted as the proportion of the variability among the observed values of $y$ that is explained by the linear regression of $y$ on $x$.

Instead, birth rate drops off rapidly at first; when the GDP per capita reaches approximately $15,000, and then begins to level off.
